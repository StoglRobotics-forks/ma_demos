# How to connect with a real robot
## Before you start:
Make sure you followed the "[How to use](https://github.com/StoglRobotics-forks/ma_demos#how-to-use)" section and installed all necessary dependencies.
## Establish a connection:

**_NOTE:_** The below provided ip addresses are only for my setup and could differ for yours.

### Laptop:
1. Plugin the wire and add a wired connection as follows:
    Setting->Connections->Add new connection->Wired Ethernet:
    The inside the IPv4 setting set the following:
    ```
    Address: 172.20.19.101
    Netmask: 255.255.255.0
    Gateway:
    ```
=> 172.20.19.101 is ip address of laptop (server)

2. In kuka_6dof_system_position_only.ros2_control.xacro:
    ```
    <hardware>
        <plugin>ros2_control_kuka_driver/KukaSystemPositionOnlyHardware</plugin>
        <param name="listen_address">172.20.19.101</param> # This need to be the ip address of your laptop
        <param name="listen_port">49152</param>
    </hardware>
    ```

### Robot:
Ip address: 172.20.19.5 (if you cannot find it you can search via `nmap -sn 172.20.19.0/255`)

**_NOTE:_** Start position: 0.0, -1.57, 1.57, 0.0, 1.57, 0.0 (at least current robot)

On the robot:
1. Turn on the switch on the electric control box
   + you should then after a few moments be able to ping your robot: `ping 172.20.19.5` which should return some bytes.
2. Switch to automatic mode (Turn small key on control panel and select aut)
3. Turn on power: On control panel press on "O"/"0" and select "I"/"1"

## Execute a program:
1. select program to run (e.g. ros_rsi_101) -> press _AnwÃ¤hlen_
2. Press the run button and then in the terminal start the rsi:

# Chained JTC
 For chained controllers the controllers have to be loaded in order they are chained, starting from the last controller in the chain. For the activation it's the other way around, starting from the hardware-side. Example:    
 Given the chain: `ForwardCommandController--->JointTrajectoryController--->Hardware`:  
 1. **First** load: ForwardCommandController, **Second** load: JointTrajectoryController.   

    _This is due the fact, that the controller manager calls controllers in the order they have been loaded._
 2. **First** activate: JointTrajectoryController, **Second** activate: ForwardCommandController.  

    _This is due the fact, that only after activation of the previous controller in the chain this controllers reference interfaces are exported. And they can only be claimed after they have been created._

 You can have a look at the: `ma_demos/kuka/kuka_bringup/launch/kuka_kr5_chained_jtc.launch.py`.
