# How to connect with a real robot
## Before you start:
Make sure you followed the "[How to use](https://github.com/StoglRobotics-forks/ma_demos#how-to-use)" section and installed all necessary dependencies.
## Establish a connection:

**_NOTE:_** The below provided ip addresses are only for my setup and could differ for yours.

### Laptop:
1. Plugin the wire and add a wired connection as follows:
    Setting->Connections->Add new connection->Wired Ethernet:
    The inside the IPv4 setting set the following:
    ```
    Address: 172.20.19.101
    Netmask: 255.255.255.0
    Gateway:
    ```
=> 172.20.19.101 is ip address of laptop (server)

2. In kuka_6dof_system_position_only.ros2_control.xacro:
    ```
    <hardware>
        <plugin>ros2_control_kuka_driver/KukaSystemPositionOnlyHardware</plugin>
        <param name="listen_address">172.20.19.101</param> # This need to be the ip address of your laptop
        <param name="listen_port">49152</param>
    </hardware>
    ```

### Robot:
Ip address: 172.20.19.5 (if you cannot find it you can search via `nmap -sn 172.20.19.0/255`)

**_NOTE:_** Start position: 0.0, -1.57, 1.57, 0.0, 1.57, 0.0 (at least current robot)

On the robot:
1. Turn on the switch on the electric control box
   + you should then after a few moments be able to ping your robot: `ping 172.20.19.5` which should return some bytes.
2. Switch to automatic mode (Turn small key on control panel and select aut)
3. Turn on power: On control panel press on "O"/"0" and select "I"/"1"

## Execute a program:
1. select program to run (e.g. ros_rsi_101) -> press _Anw√§hlen_
2. Press the run button and then in the terminal start the rsi:
